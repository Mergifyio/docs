title: Quarantine
description: Ignore problematic tests in your CI
---

The Quarantine feature lets you isolate broken or flaky tests in your CI pipeline without removing them entirely.
Once a test is quarantined via the Mergify dashboard, it will still run in your CI â€” but its failure
will be ignored for the purposes of blocking merges or marking a pipeline as failed.

This helps you keep your CI green while maintaining full visibility into test reliability and ongoing issues.

## How Quarantine Works

When you quarantine a test in the Mergify dashboard, its future executions will continue to be collected by
[CI Insights](/ci-insights/), but your CI will ignore failures.

This avoids pipeline disruption while still surfacing issues in the UI and keeping historical data intact.

Quarantined tests must still be uploaded appropriately using one of the supported CI integrations.
To ensure the correct setup, refer to [the documentation for your test framework](/ci-insights/#test-framework-configuration).

## Adding and removing tests from quarantine

### From The Mergify Dashboard

The ["Tests" view of CI Insights](https://dashboard.mergify.com/ci-insights/tests) on the dashboard contains the list of
tests that were retrieve from the CI Insights integration.
Clicking on a test in this list will bring you to the "Test Details" view of the test,
which will allowyou to add or remove a test from quarantine.
