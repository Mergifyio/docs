Flaky test detection helps you identify tests that produce inconsistent results
on the same code, allowing you to improve the reliability of your test suite
and reduce false positives in your CI pipeline.

## Understanding Flaky Tests

A **flaky test** is one that has different conclusions on the same SHA1. For
example, if a test runs twice on the same commit and once fails while the other
succeeds, it's considered flaky because the outcome is not consistent with the
same code.

Flaky tests are problematic because they:

- Create false positives that block legitimate deployments
- Reduce confidence in your test suite
- Waste developer time investigating non-issues
- Can mask real bugs when they fail intermittently

## How Flaky Detection Works

Flaky test detection works by running your test suite multiple times on the
same commit. When tests produce different results (pass/fail) across these runs
on identical code, they are flagged as flaky. This approach helps identify
tests that are unreliable and may cause false positives or negatives in your CI
pipeline.

## Setting Up Flaky Test Detection

To effectively detect flaky tests, you need to run the same tests multiple
times on the same code (identified by the SHA1 of the repository). This section
explains how to set up your CI to systematically detect flaky tests.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up flaky test detection, ensure you have:

1. [Enabled CI Insights](/ci-insights#enabling-ci-insights-for-github)
   for your repository

2. Set up your `MERGIFY_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions secrets

3. Configured test integration (e.g., `pytest-mergify` or `mergify cli upload`)
   for your test framework

### GitHub Actions Setup

The recommended approach is to use a scheduled workflow that runs your test
suite multiple times on the default branch. Here's an example configuration
that runs tests twice daily with 5 parallel executions:

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */12 * * 1-5'  # Every 12 hours, Monday to Friday

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        run: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Run the same tests 5 times in parallel
      fail-fast: false  # Don't cancel other runs if one fails

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup your environment
        # Add your specific setup steps here (Python, Node.js, etc.)

      - name: Run Tests
        env:
          MERGIFY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.MERGIFY_TOKEN }}
          RUN_COUNT: 5  # Number of times to run each test
        run: |
          # Run your test suite multiple times to detect flakiness
          set +e
          failed=0
          for i in $(seq "$RUN_COUNT"); do
            # Replace this with your actual test command
            # Examples:
            # pytest tests/
            # npm test
            # go test ./...
            your-test-command
            exit_code=$?
            if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ]; then
              failed=1
            fi
          done
          exit $failed
```

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */12 * * 1-5'  # Every 12 hours, Monday to Friday

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup your environment
        # Add your specific setup steps here (Python, Node.js, etc.)

      # Modified: Run tests multiple times for flaky detection
      - name: Run tests
        env:
          # Run tests 5 times on schedule, once on pull_request
          RUN_COUNT: ${{ github.event_name == 'schedule' && 5 || 1 }}
        run: |
          # Run the test suite based on RUN_COUNT
          for i in $(seq $RUN_COUNT); do
            echo "Running test suite - attempt $i of $RUN_COUNT"

            # Run your test command with unique output file, e.g.:
            # npm test -- --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit --outputFile=test-results-$i.xml
          done

      # Upload all test results to CI Insights
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: mergifyio/gha-mergify-ci@v6
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.MERGIFY_TOKEN }}
          report_path: test-results-*.xml
```

### Configuration Tips

- **Frequency**: Running twice daily (every 12 hours) provides a good balance
  between detection accuracy and resource usage

- **Parallel Execution**: Use matrix strategy to run multiple test executions
  simultaneously

- **fail-fast: false**: Ensure all test runs complete even if some fail

- **Default Branch Only**: Focus on the default branch where flaky tests have
  the most impact

- **Weekday Schedule**: The example runs Monday to Friday (`1-5`) to avoid
  running when no changes are made on the code

### Key Environment Variables

- `MERGIFY_TOKEN`: Required for uploading test results to CI Insights
- `RUN_COUNT`: Number of times to execute each test within a single job

## Interpreting Flaky Test Results

Once your flaky test detection is running, CI Insights will analyze the results
and identify patterns:

### In the CI Insights Dashboard

1. **Tests View**: Navigate to the Tests section in CI Insights to see tests flagged as flaky
2. **Consistency Metrics**: View the success/failure ratio for each test across multiple runs
3. **Timeline Analysis**: See when flakiness was first detected and how it trends over time
4. **Impact Assessment**: Understand which tests are causing the most CI instability

### What to Look For

- **High Flakiness Rate**: Tests that fail inconsistently across runs on the same commit
- **Recent Flakiness**: Newly introduced flaky behavior that may indicate recent code changes
- **Critical Path Tests**: Flaky tests in important workflows that could block deployments
- **Patterns**: Flakiness that occurs under specific conditions (time of day, load, etc.)

### Taking Action

When flaky tests are identified:

1. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on tests that affect critical workflows
   first

2. **Investigate Root Causes**: Look for timing issues, external dependencies,
   or race conditions

3. **Improve Test Reliability**: Add proper waits, mocks, or test isolation

4. **Monitor Progress**: Use CI Insights to verify that fixes reduce flakiness
   over time

## Common Causes of Flaky Tests

Understanding common causes can help you fix flaky tests more effectively:

### Timing Issues

- **Race conditions**: Tests that depend on timing between operations

- **Insufficient waits**: Tests that don't wait long enough for operations to
  complete

- **Timeouts**: Tests with hardcoded timeouts that may vary in different
  environments

### External Dependencies

- **Network calls**: Tests that make real HTTP requests
- **Database state**: Tests that depend on specific database state
- **File system**: Tests that read/write files without proper cleanup

### Test Isolation

- **Shared state**: Tests that affect each other's state
- **Order dependencies**: Tests that only pass when run in a specific order
- **Resource conflicts**: Tests competing for the same resources

### Environment Variations

- **System load**: Tests sensitive to CPU or memory usage
- **Date/time dependencies**: Tests that depend on current time
- **Random data**: Tests using non-deterministic random values

## Best Practices for Reliable Tests

To prevent flaky tests:

1. **Use deterministic data**: Replace random values with fixed test data
2. **Mock external dependencies**: Isolate tests from network, database, and file system
3. **Implement proper waits**: Use explicit waits instead of fixed sleeps
4. **Clean up after tests**: Ensure each test starts with a clean state
5. **Make tests independent**: Each test should be able to run in isolation
6. **Use stable selectors**: In UI tests, use reliable element selectors
7. **Handle async operations**: Properly wait for asynchronous operations to complete
