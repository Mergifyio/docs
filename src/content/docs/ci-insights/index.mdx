## Enabling CI Insights for GitHub

1. Enable CI Insights on your repositories by visiting the [GitHub Integration
   page](https://dashboard.mergify.com/integrations/github)
   ([docs](/integrations/github)).

2. In order to upload your test results, you'll need to [configure your
   test](#test-framework-configuration). Before doing so, makes sure you set
   your `MERGIFY_TOKEN` in GitHub in your GitHub Actions secrets.

   To find your token in the Mergify dashboard, go to `Settings` and then `CI
   Insights`:

   <Image src={TokenScreenshot} alt="CI Insights Token" />

   Once you copy it, you'll need to paste it to into your secrets:

   <Image src={GHSecretsScreenshot} alt="GitHub Actions Secrets" />

   This token will be used to upload test reports. See below to configure them.

3. Click on `CI Insights` in the navigation bar from Mergify dashboard. You
   should see your first GitHub Actions job run here.

details about your test runs. Each framework requires a quick setup to ensure
test results are captured correctly. Refer to the dedicated pages for your
specific framework to configure and verify your test output.
