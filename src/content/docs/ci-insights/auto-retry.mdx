CI Insights Auto-Retry helps reduce false negatives in your CI pipeline by
automatically retrying failed jobs that may have failed due to flaky tests or
transient issues. This feature improves the reliability of your CI process
while providing insights into which jobs are consistently problematic.

## How Auto-Retry Works

When a CI job fails, Auto-Retry analyzes the failure based on configurable
rules to determine if it should be retried.

### Retry Process

1. **Detection**: Auto-Retry monitors workflow runs for job failures

2. **Rule Evaluation**: When jobs fail, the system evaluates them against your
configured retry rules

3. **Wait for Completion**: If any job matches a retry rule, Auto-Retry waits
   for the entire workflow to complete

4. **Workflow Retry**: Once complete, the entire workflow is retried,
   re-running all failed jobs

5. **Success Preservation**: Previously successful jobs are not re-executed

:::note
Due to GitHub API limitations, Auto-Retry works at the workflow
level. When a job matches a retry rule, the entire workflow is retried,
re-running all failed jobs while preserving successful ones.

## Benefits

- **Reduced False Negatives**: Automatically handle transient failures that
  don't represent real code issues

- **Improved Developer Experience**: Fewer interruptions from flaky test
  failures

- **Better CI Reliability**: More consistent build results across your pipeline

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Track which jobs are frequently retried to identify
  systematic issues

- **Time Savings**: Reduce manual retry actions and faster feedback loops

## Configuration

Auto-Retry uses a rule-based system to determine which workflow runs should be
retried. Rules are evaluated against individual jobs, but retries occur at the
workflow level.

### Basic Setup

To enable Auto-Retry for your repositories:

1. Navigate to your Mergify dashboard
2. Go to **CI Insights** â†’ **Auto-Retry**
3. Select the repositories you want to enable Auto-Retry for
4. Configure your retry rules

### Retry Rules

Auto-Retry rules define when a workflow should be retried based on job
failures. Each rule specifies:

- **Conditions**: When the job failure should trigger a workflow retry
- **Number of retries**: Maximum number of retries and timing constraints
