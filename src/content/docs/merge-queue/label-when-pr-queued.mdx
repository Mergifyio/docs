title: Adding a label when a PR is queued
description: Control the label your Merge Queue adds to pull requests when they are queued.
---

By default, Mergify adds the `queued` label to pull requests when they are added to the merge queue.
Mergify will also remove the label when pull requests are dequeued or merged.

This default behavior can be modified through the use of the `queued_label` attribute
under the `merge_queue` configuration section in your Mergify configuration file.

You can customize this behavior by specifying a different label in your Mergify configuration file:

```yaml
merge_queue:
  queued_label: "my-custom-label"
```

You can also disable the addition of any label by setting the `queued_label` attribute to `null`:

```yaml
merge_queue:
  queued_label: null
```
