Mergify's Merge Queue offers a feature known as "pausing" that grants users
increased control over the automation process during special circumstances.
Let's explore what pausing involves, its impacts, and its typical use cases.

## What Does Pausing Do?

When you pause the merge queue:

1. **Suspended**: The merge queue will be suspended.

2. **Addition to the Queue Continues**: Even with a paused merge queue, new
   pull requests can still join the queue. This ensures pull requests remain
   organized and ready for when operations resume.

3. **Stops Scheduling and Actions**: After pausing the merge queue, Mergify
   will not schedule new checks or merge pull requests. Pull requests can enter
   the queue but won't be acted upon.

4. **Cancel Running Checks**: As soon as the queue is paused, Mergify cancels
   any running checks and waits for the queue to be resumed.

## How to Pause the Merge Queues

### From the Dashboard

Navigate to your [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com). There
you'll find an option to pause the merge queue. Clicking on this will suspend
the queue.

### Using the API

You can also pause the merge queue programmatically using the [Mergify
API](/api-usage).

## Typical Use Cases

### CI Incidents

During a major incident with the Continuous Integration (CI) system, the pause
feature can be invaluable. If there's a likelihood that checks will fail and
consequently eject the pull request from the queue, it's beneficial to pause
the merge queue.

### Non-CI Incidents

If an incident is unrelated to the CI, like a production issue, but you wish to
halt merging while allowing checks to run, then the [scheduled freeze
feature](/merge-protections/#scheduling-freezes) is a more suitable choice.

## Benefits of Using the Pause Feature

1. **Maintain Queue Integrity**: During CI failures or other disruptions,
   pausing ensures pull requests stay in the queue, preserving their order.

2. **Flexibility**: It provides an immediate response tool during unexpected
   complications, giving you control over the merge process.

3. **Reduce Noise**: Constantly failing checks during a CI incident can create
   unnecessary notifications. Pausing the queue mitigates this.

The pause feature of the Mergify merge queue offers users an enhanced layer of
control and adaptability during special situations. Familiarizing yourself with
when and how to pause your merge queue can optimize your workflow and reduce
disruptions.
