Once you've configured your merge queue, you can deploy it using one of two approaches:

**Approach 1: Hybrid Mode** — Mergify and manual merges coexist. This is the
simplest way to start and requires no additional setup.

**Approach 2: Exclusive Mode** — Only Mergify can merge pull requests (enforced
via GitHub rulesets). This provides the most streamlined workflow.

Both approaches are optional—choose what works best for your team.

## Approach 1: Hybrid Mode

In hybrid mode, developers can use the merge queue or merge manually—both work
simultaneously. This is the default behavior and requires no setup.

### When to Use Hybrid Mode

- **Getting started**: Your team is new to merge queues
- **Gradual transition**: You want minimal disruption to existing workflows
- **Flexibility**: Some PRs need manual merging for specific reasons

### Tradeoffs

- **Queue disruption**: Manual merges can interrupt the automated queue flow
- **Extra CI time**: Manual merges may reset queued jobs, increasing CI usage (disable with `reset_on_external_merge: never`)

### Best Practices

**Educate your team** on when to use the queue vs. manual merges.

**Monitor usage** to track adoption. Add this rule to get notified of manual merges:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: notify on manual merge
    conditions:
      - merged
      - merged-by != mergify[bot]
    actions:
      comment:
        message: Hey @{{author}}, this PR was merged manually. Consider using the merge queue next time!
```

**Gather feedback** from your team and address any issues they encounter.

## Approach 2: Exclusive Mode

In exclusive mode, only Mergify can merge pull requests. This is enforced using
GitHub rulesets and provides the most consistent, automated workflow.

### When to Use Exclusive Mode

- **Your team is comfortable** with the merge queue
- **You want consistency**: All PRs follow the same automated process
- **Optimal performance**: Eliminates queue disruptions from manual merges

### How to Enable Exclusive Mode

1. Navigate to **Merge Queue > Deploy** in your Mergify dashboard.

   <Image src={bpDashboardScreenshot} alt="Deploy screen from Mergify dashboard"/>

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to configure your GitHub ruleset.

3. Click the verification button to confirm your setup is correct.

**Be careful**: Mergify injects ruleset rules as conditions in the Merge Queue. However,
if Mergify has bypass permissions for the rules, the conditions will not be injected.

If you want to add more rules to this ruleset, ensure they are rules that you allow Mergify to bypass.
Otherwise, set them in a separate ruleset without Mergify in the bypass list.
