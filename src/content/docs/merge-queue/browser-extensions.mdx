## Why use the browser extensions?

The Chrome and Firefox extensions inject a small Mergify toolbar into every GitHub pull request you
open. The toolbar exposes the most common merge queue actions (such as queueing a pull request)
without having to type [commands](/commands). Use it when you want to:

- Enqueue a pull request as soon as you review it.
- Quickly dequeue without context switching.
- See at a glance whether the pull request is already in one of your queues.

## Locate the official download links

The dashboard keeps the canonical links to the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons listing so you
always grab the signed builds.

1. Sign in to the [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com).
2. Open `Settings → Browser Extensions` in the left navigation.
3. Pick **Add to Chrome** or **Add to Firefox**.

## Install on Chrome or Firefox

### Chrome

1. Click **Add to Chrome** from the dashboard page.
2. Confirm the permissions in the Chrome Web Store dialog.

### Firefox

1. Click **Add to Firefox** from the dashboard page.
2. Approve the requested permissions in the Firefox Add-ons prompt.

## Use the queue controls inside GitHub

After installation, reload any pull request on GitHub. A Mergify toolbar appears near the GitHub
merge box and displays queue-specific controls:

- **Queue** places the pull request into the selected merge queue with one click.

- **Dequeue** (available when the pull request is already in the queue) removes it without typing
  slash commands.
