Mergify’s Merge Queue automates and secures your PR merging process. It ensures
each PR meets all conditions (status checks, branch rules, reviews, etc.)
before merging, so your main branch stays stable — without manual tracking or
coordination.

:::note
For more details about merge queues and their functions, you can refer to our
[merge queue introduction](./).

## Default Merge Queue

Every repo connected to Mergify gets a queue automatically. By default, it
respects your GitHub [branch protection
settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
and
[rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).

## Adding a Pull Request to the Merge Queue

<Youtube video="2mVymDFMaMk" title="Add a PR to the merge queue"/>

To add a pull request to the merge queue, use [the `queue`
command](/commands/queue). This adds your PR to the merge queue as long as it
matches the queue conditions.

Remember, the PR will only be merged once the conditions defined in the
`merge_conditions` field are met.

You can also [configure Mergify to automatically queue pull requests that are
ready](rules/#autoqueueing-pull-requests).

## Configuring the Merge Queue Rules

To have a more refined control over the PRs entering the merge queue and when
they get merged, you can configure multiple queue rules in your Mergify
configuration file. This allows to define custom conditions that should be met
before a PR is added to the queue (`queue_conditions`) and when it can be
merged (`merge_conditions`).

See [queue rules](/merge-queue/rules/).

## Monitoring Your Merge Queue

After you've added pull requests to your merge queue, you want to monitor its
status to understand the progression of your PRs. This can be done directly
from the [Mergify dashboard](http://dashboard.mergify.com).

<Image src={queueStatusScreenshot} alt="Mergify Queue Status" />

Here, you can view all the PRs in the queue and their current statuses. PRs
that are waiting for their `merge_conditions` to be met are marked as pending,
while those that have met all their `queue_conditions` are displayed in the
queue and will be merged when they reach the top of the queue.

Remember, the PRs in the queue are ordered based on their addition time. The PR
added first will be merged first after all its conditions are met. You can
modify the order of the pull request inside a queue using
[priorities](/merge-queue/priority).

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've just set up your first Merge Queue with Mergify! You're
now armed with a powerful tool to automate and streamline your PR merging
process, reducing the potential for conflicts and ensuring your main branch is
always in a consistent, deployable state.

However, setting up a basic merge queue is just the beginning. Mergify's
powerful and flexible configuration system enables you to tailor your merge
queue to your specific needs.

For further exploration and inspiration, here are some additional resources and
use cases that you might find useful:

- Using [priorities to order your pull requests](/merge-queue/priority);

- Speeding up your merge queue with [parallel
  checks](/merge-queue/parallel-checks);

- Saving CI time with [batches](/merge-queue/batches);

- Delaying [checks at merge time](/merge-queue/two-step);

Remember, the possibilities with a merge queue are limited only by your
imagination. Happy merging!
