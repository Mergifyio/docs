Monitoring your merge queue's key metrics helps you identify bottlenecks,
optimize throughput, and maintain an efficient development cycle.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### PRs Merged Per Day
Track the number of pull requests merged each day. A consistent trend indicates
a stable development environment. Sudden drops or spikes can indicate issues
that need attention.

### CI Runtime
Monitor how long your Continuous Integration tests take to run. A sudden
increase in runtime can slow down your entire merge queue and delay other PRs.

### Queue Checks Outcome
Track the success rate of PRs in the queue. High success rates indicate a
healthy development and review process. Frequent failures may signal a need for
process refinement or CI improvements.

### Queue Size
Monitor the number of PRs waiting in the queue. If the queue grows
significantly or continuously, it indicates a bottleneck or inefficiency in
your process or CI.

### Running Checks
Monitor the number of checks currently running. If you're often at full
capacity, consider increasing the number of parallel checks to improve
throughput.

### Queue Waiting Time
Track how long PRs spend idle in the queue. Extended waiting times increase
overall latency and can delay the delivery of features or fixes.
