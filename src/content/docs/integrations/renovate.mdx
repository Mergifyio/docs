[Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) scans your software, discovers
dependencies, automatically checks to see if an updated version exists, and
submits automated pull requests.

## Automating Renovate Pull Request Merges

There are two primary ways to automate the merging of Renovate PRs with
Mergify:

### 1. Direct Merge or Merge Queue

You can set up a pull request rule to automatically merge Renovate PRs or
place them in the merge queue.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically merge Renovate PRs
    conditions:
      - author = renovate[bot]
    actions:
      merge:
      # Or use queue: to use the merge queue
```

### 2. PR Approval

If you have GitHub's branch protection set up to require approvals, you can use
Mergify to automatically approve Renovate PRs.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically approve Renovate PRs
    conditions:
      - author = renovate[bot]
    actions:
      review:
        type: APPROVE
```

## Batching Dependency Updates

For projects where there are frequent updates to a large number of small
libraries, it's efficient to batch these updates together. Using Mergify's
merge queue feature, you can automatically batch and test these updates
together, reducing CI load and ensuring compatibility.

For example, you could set up a merge queue to batch those PRs 10 by 10:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  # If you have other queues defined, add this at the end so it is processed last
  - name: dep-update
    batch_size: 10
    # Wait for up to 30 minutes for the batch to fill up
    batch_max_wait_time: 30 min
    queue_conditions:
      - author = renovate[bot]

pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automatically queue Renovate PRs
    conditions:
      - author = renovate[bot]
    actions:
      queue:
```

With Mergify and Renovate working together, you can ensure your project's
dependencies are always up-to-date with minimal effort, ensuring a smooth and
efficient update process.
