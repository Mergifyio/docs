Mergify is fully integrated with GitHub and many functionalities requires
Mergify to be installed on your repositories.

## Configuring Enabled Products

You can configure the products that are enabled on your GitHub repositories by
clicking on `Integrations` and then on `GitHub / Configure`.

for new repositories where the Mergify GitHub App is installed.

Then, you can add repositories by clicking on `Add Repository` and installing
the Mergify GitHub App on them.
