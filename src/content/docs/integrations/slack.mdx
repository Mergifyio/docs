Mergify offers a native integration with Slack, allowing you to receive events
from your Merge Queue directly in one or multiple Slack channels. This
integration helps you stay updated on your merge activities without leaving
Slack. Here's how you can set it up:

To receive Merge Queue events directly in Slack:
1. Go to your Mergify dashboard.
2. Navigate to Integrations â†’ Slack.
3. Follow the prompts to connect your Slack workspace.
4. Select the Slack channel where you want to receive Merge Queue notifications.

With this setup, you'll get real-time updates about your Merge Queue, keeping
your team informed and enabling quicker responses to any issues.

## Using GitHub-Slack Integration with Mergify

In addition to the native integration, you can also receive Slack notifications
based on Mergify actions by leveraging the GitHub to Slack integration. Here's
a step-by-step guide:

### Setting Up GitHub-Slack Integration

1. Go to [Slack's GitHub Integration page](https://slack.github.com/).

2. Click on the 'Add to Slack' button.

3. Invite the GitHub app to the channel you want. Refer to the
   [documentation](https://github.com/integrations/slack/blob/master/README.md)
   for more details.

4. Make sure you subscribe to the repositories [to receive the
   mentions](https://github.com/integrations/slack/blob/master/README.md#mentions)
   as private message for the GitHub Slack app.

Now that the Slack-GitHub integration is complete, let's see how you can use
Mergify to mention a user, which will then notify them on Slack.

### Using Mergify's Comment Action with Slack Notifications

The primary idea is to use Mergify's (`comment`)[/workflow/actions/comment/]
action to mention the PR author, leveraging GitHub's mention feature. This
mention will be forwarded to Slack, notifying the mentioned user.

Here's an example of a Mergify configuration that comments on a PR if a CI
fails and the label is "hotfix":

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Notify author on CI failure for hotfixes
    conditions:
      - "#check-failure > 0"
      - "label = hotfix"
    actions:
      comment:
        message: "@{{author}} :warning: The CI failed on this hotfix PR. Please review the issues and address them."
```

In the above rule:

- We're checking if there are any CI failures with `#check-failure > 0`.

- We're also ensuring that the PR has the label `hotfix`.

- If both conditions are met, Mergify will leave a comment mentioning the PR
  author using `@{{author}}`. This mention will trigger a notification in Slack
  if the author has their GitHub integrated with Slack.

By setting up this flow, you can ensure that critical PRs, like those labeled
"hotfix", receive immediate attention from their authors, even if they're
primarily monitoring Slack.
