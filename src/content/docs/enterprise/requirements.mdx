## GitHub Requirements

To be able to enroll your on-premise Mergify on GitHub, you need a GitHub
account with enough permissions (Organization owner or [GitHub App
manager](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/permission-levels-for-an-organization#github-app-managers))
to create and install the GitHub App.

## PostgreSQL Requirements

Mergify stores dashboard logins plus encrypted credentials in Postgres. Minimum sizing:

- Version 15 or newer
- 10 GB of disk
- 2 GB of memory

High-availability clusters are recommended for production setups, but a single instance that meets
these specs is sufficient for proofs of concept.

## Redis Requirements

Redis persists queued events, cached repository metadata, and recovery data for
GitHub outages. Your instance or cluster must provide:

- Redis 6.2+
- 200 concurrent connections
- 250 MB of durable storage
- At least 16 logical databases
- TLS endpoint
- Persistence enabled (AOF every second)

You can choose any managed Redis service with TLS and AOF enabled, or run your
own deployment. For example, the [Bitnami
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/redis) can be started with TLS and
persistence:

```sh
docker run --name some-redis-with-tls -d \
    -v /host/dir/redis/persisted/data:/bitnami/redis/data \
    -v /host/dir/redis/persisted/certs:/opt/bitnami/redis/certs \
    -e REDIS_PASSWORD=my_master_password \
    -e REDIS_TLS_ENABLED=yes \
    -e REDIS_TLS_CERT_FILE=/opt/bitnami/redis/certs/redis.crt \
    -e REDIS_TLS_KEY_FILE=/opt/bitnami/redis/certs/redis.key \
    -e REDIS_TLS_CA_FILE=/opt/bitnami/redis/certs/redisCA.crt \
    -n redis-server \
    bitnami/redis
```

## Mergify Requirements

The Mergify container needs at leas:

- 4 GB of RAM
- 2 vCPUs

On AWS, a `m5.large` instance fits well.

The service listens on HTTP port 5000 for the dashboard/API and webhook intake,
and it must sit behind a reverse proxy that:

- Terminates TLS
- Is exposed publicly through DNS over HTTPS
- Sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header

Some features (copy, backport, rebase) write to `/tmp`, so ensure the host or node offers roughly
10 GB of scratch space for repositories of similar size.

## GitHub Server Requirements

Mergify Enterprise supports:

- GitHub.com
- GitHub Enterprise Server 3.2 or newer (3.6+ recommended)

## External Network Access

Two outbound HTTPS calls must be allowed so Mergify can validate and report licensing:

- `GET https://subscription.mergify.com/on-premise/subscription/<random-id>`
- `POST https://subscription.mergify.com/on-premise/report`

These requests are performed by the workers; restrict egress for other components when possible.
