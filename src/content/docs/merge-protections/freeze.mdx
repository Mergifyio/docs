## When to Use a Freeze

Use freezes to coordinate:
- Critical release stabilization
- High-traffic events where deploy risk must be minimized
- End-of-quarter / audit windows
- Incident response (manual immediate freeze)

## Creating a Scheduled Freeze

<Image src={scheduleFreezeScreen} alt="Scheduled Freezes" />

In the dashboard under Merge Protections â†’ Freezes:
1. Click `Schedule a Freeze`

2. Define start / end (UTC)

3. Add matching conditions: by default the freeze applies to every pull
   requests, but you can limit its impact with this field

4. Save; active freezes appear in the list

During a freeze, the protection check fails with a clear message unless an
override condition is met (see below).

## Manual Instant Freeze

Use the `Freeze Merges Now` action for immediate blocking. You can later
unfreeze manually.

## Allowing Exceptions

Create a rule with a success condition that grants override, e.g.:

```yaml
- label != hotfix
```

Then apply the `hotfix` label (manually or via automation) to bypass the freeze
for a specific PR.
