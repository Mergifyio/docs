## Enable in the Dashboard

1. Go to the [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com)
2. Click the `Merge Protections` section
3. Select your repository
4. Enable the feature and create rules

## Reporting Method: check-runs vs deployments

You can configure how Merge Protections report their status to GitHub using the
`reporting_method` option in your configuration. This controls whether the
protection status appears as a GitHub Check Run or as a Deployment.

- `check-runs` (default): Reports the protection status as a standard GitHub
  check on the pull request. This is the most common and compatible method.

- `deployments`: Reports the protection status as a GitHub Deployment. This can
  be useful if your workflow or compliance requirements rely on deployment
  status.

  <Image src={deployScreenshot} alt="Merge Protections deploy success" />

Example configuration:
```yaml
merge_protections_settings:
    reporting_method: check-runs  # or deployments
    # Post a comment with details about required rules
    post_comment: true
```

Choose the method that best fits your integration and compliance needs.

## Make the Check Required

Enabling inserts a check named `Mergify Merge Protections` on each pull
request. Mark it as required, either as a checks or deployment:

- GitHub Branch Protection: Settings → Branches → Add/Edit rule → Require
  status checks / deployment to succeed → select `Mergify Merge Protections`

- GitHub Rulesets: Settings → Rules → Select ruleset → Add required status
  check / deployment to succeed → `Mergify Merge Protections`

Once required, the check blocks merges whenever any active protection fails and
explains why in its output & a summary comment.

## Updating Rules

- Safe to edit live; re-evaluations happen automatically.
- Renaming a rule only changes display text; logic is defined by the condition blocks.
- Remove obsolete rules to keep explanations short.
