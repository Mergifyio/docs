## Enable in the Dashboard

1. Go to the [Mergify dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com)
2. Click the `Merge Protections` section
3. Select your repository
4. Enable the feature and create rules

## Make the Check Required

Enabling inserts a check named `Mergify Merge Protections` on each pull request. Mark it as required:

- GitHub Branch Protection: Settings → Branches → Add/Edit rule → Require status checks → select `Mergify Merge Protections`
- GitHub Rulesets: Settings → Rules → Select ruleset → Add required status check → `Mergify Merge Protections`

Once required, the check blocks merges whenever any active protection fails and
explains why in its output & a summary comment.

## Updating Rules

- Safe to edit live; re-evaluations happen automatically.
- Renaming a rule only changes display text; logic is defined by the condition blocks.
- Remove obsolete rules to keep explanations short.
