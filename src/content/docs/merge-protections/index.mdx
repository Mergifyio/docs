[GitHub's branch
protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches)
and
[rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)
are foundational, but their customizations are somewhat limited.

For more advanced or specific scenarios, Mergify's Merge Protections can step
in, enabling you to define nuanced conditions that cater to your project's
unique needs. This flexibility means you can design branch protection rules
that the native system simply can't handle.

## Why Mergify Over Native GitHub Branch Protection and Rulesets?

1. **Advanced Conditions**: Mergify supports a vast array of conditions, which
   means you can create extremely specific rules based on any of the pull
   request metadata.

2. **Dependencies**: Leverage dependencies between pull requests.

3. **Scheduled Merges**: Make sure merges are done on the right time.

4. **Freeze**: Schedule one-time or recurring total or partial freeze for your
   repository.

## Enabling Merge Protections

Merge protections can be configured directly from your
[dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com) by clicking on the `Merge
Protections` link in the sidebar.

Once enabled on your repository, Mergify will post a check entitled `Mergify
Merge Protections` on your pull requests. You need to ensure this checks is
required in your branch protection settings or in your rulesets.

<Image src={bpScreen} alt="GitHub Branch Protection" />

Once `Mergify Merge Protections` is required in your repository rules, it will
be marked as enforced in your GitHub checks and will prevent any pull request
to be merged if does not match your conditions.

Mergify will also post an update as a comment on pull requests, including
details of the matching protections.

## Built-in Protections

Mergify provides multiple built-in protections that are available
out-of-the-box.

### Depends-On

The Depends-On protection prevents pull request to be merged if the dependent
pull requests are not yet merged.

To use this feature, you simply need to list pull request dependencies in the
pull request body using one of the following format:

```yaml
Depends-On: #123
Depends-On: https://github.com/myorg/myrepo/pull/123
Depends-On: myorg/myrepo#123
```

<Image src={dependsOnBody} alt="Using Depends-On in the pull request body on GitHub"/>

A pull request can depends on any other pull request if both those conditions
are matched:
- Mergify is enabled on the target repository;
- The repository is part of the same organization.

### Merge-After

You can use the `Merge-After` pull request header to merge a pull request after
a certain date using our [timestamp format](/configuration/data-types#timestamp).

<Image src={mergeAfterBody} alt="Using Merge-After in the pull request body on GitHub"/>

## Adding New Rules

You can add any new rule by clicking on the `New Rule` button and using a
template or writing from scratch.

The format of the rules is as follow:

```yaml
name: <name of your rule>
description: <description of your rule>
if: <list of conditions that the pull request needs to match to see the rule applied>
success_conditions: <list of conditions that needs to match for the check to be a success>
```

You can refer to [the format of the conditions](/configuration/conditions/) for
more details.

For example, to check that your pull request targeting the `main` branch
follows the conventional commit convention you can write:

```yaml
name: Enforce conventional commit
description: Make sure that we follow https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
if:
  - base = main
success_conditions:
  - "title ~= ^(fix|feat|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(?:(.+))?:"
```

## Scheduling Freezes

If you want to prevent pull request to be merged during certain periods, you
can create scheduled freezes on your repository.

You can also freeze your repository instantly by clicking on "Freeze Merges
Now".
