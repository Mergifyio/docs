title: Mergify Queue Command
description: Add a pull request to a merge queue.
---

The `queue` command in Mergify offers users a direct way to interact with the
[Mergify merge queue](/merge-queue), right from their pull request
comments. By utilizing this command, users can add a pull request to a merge
queue or re-add it after it has been dequeued.

To enter a queue, a pull request must match the `queue_conditions` of the
targeted queue. See [Adding a Pull Request to the Merge
Queue](/merge-queue/lifecycle#adding-a-pull-request-to-the-merge-queue) for
more details.

:::tip[Tips]
  If you're unsure about the state or position of your pull request within a
  queue, refer to [Mergify's dashboard](https://dashboard.mergify.com) for a
  visual representation.

## Syntax

```text
@mergifyio queue [queue-name]
```

## Parameters

- `[queue-name]` is an optional queue name. If no queue name is specified, the
  pull request will be queued in the first queue that matches the
  `queue_conditions`.

## Example

### Adding a Pull Request to a Queue

To add a pull request to a queue, simply use:

```text
@mergifyio queue
```

This command will place the pull request in the first queue that matches
`queue_conditions`.

### Adding a Pull Request to a Specific Queue

To add a pull request to a specific queue, simply use:

```text
@mergifyio queue production
```

This command will place the pull request in the `production` queue as soon as
it passes its `queue_conditions`.

### Re-queuing a Previously Dequeued Pull Request

If a pull request was removed from the merge queue — whether due to a failed
check, a flaky test, or a manual `dequeue` — you can re-add it using the same
`queue` command:

```text
@mergifyio queue
```

The command resets the pull request status and places it back in the merge
queue, allowing Mergify to retry validation.

:::note
  The `requeue` command is deprecated. Use `@mergifyio queue` for both
  initial queuing and re-queuing.
