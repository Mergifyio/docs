Mergify's merge queue prevents broken main branches by ensuring every PR is
tested against the latest code before merging. No more "it worked on my branch"
failures.

## What Mergify Solves

### Broken Main Branch

PRs that pass CI individually can break main when merged together. Mergify
updates each PR against the latest main and re-runs CI before merging—catching
conflicts before they hit production.

**→ [How the queue works](/merge-queue/lifecycle)**

### Slow Merge Throughput

Serial testing creates bottlenecks. Mergify tests multiple PRs in parallel
using speculative execution, so your queue moves as fast as your CI allows.

**→ [Parallel checks](/merge-queue/parallel-checks)**

### Spiraling CI Costs

Running full test suites on every PR is expensive. Mergify batches PRs together
into single CI runs and supports two-step CI to run heavy tests only at merge
time.

**→ [Batches](/merge-queue/batches) | [Two-step CI](/merge-queue/two-step)**

### Monorepo Complexity

Unrelated changes shouldn't block each other. Mergify uses scopes to identify
which services a PR affects and only batches compatible changes together.

**→ [Scopes](/merge-queue/scopes) | [Monorepo guide](/merge-queue/monorepo)**
