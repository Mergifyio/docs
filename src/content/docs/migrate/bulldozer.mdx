title: Migrate from Bulldozer to Mergify
description: Map Bulldozer configuration and behaviors to Mergify rules and merge queue.
---

[Bulldozer](https://github.com/palantir/bulldozer) focuses on automerging pull
requests based on labels, reviews, and status checks. Mergify covers that and
more, with a powerful rule engine and a production‑grade merge queue.

This page shows a practical, minimal‑diff path to move from Bulldozer to
Mergify.

:::tip[Need help?]

We’ve migrated many teams from Bulldozer. [Reach
out](mailto:support@mergify.com) and we’ll review your Bulldozer configuration
and propose an equivalent Mergify setup.

:::

## Typical Migration Plan

1. Keep your labels and branch protections as‑is
2. Translate Bulldozer settings to one or two Mergify rules
3. Start with a dry‑run or low‑impact setup and expand gradually

## Common Bulldozer config → Mergify

Example Bulldozer snippet:

```yaml
merge:
  trigger:
    label: ["merge when ready"]
    branch_patterns: ["feature/.*"]
  method: squash
  required_statuses:
    - "ci/circleci: ete-tests"
```

Equivalent Mergify:

```yaml title=.mergify.yml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Automerge when ready
    conditions:
      - label = merge when ready
      - head ~= ^feature/
      - "check-success = ci/circleci: ete-tests"
    actions:
      merge:
        method: squash
```

Notes:
- Checks map to `check-success = <name>` (or `check-skipped`, `check-neutral`)
- Required labels map to `label = <name>` conditions
- Approvals map to review count or specific reviewers

## Enabling the Merge Queue (optional but recommended)

If you rely on Bulldozer plus manual rebases to keep PRs up‑to‑date, [Mergify’s
Merge Queue](/merge-queue) removes that toil — with even more optimizations.

Add a queue rule and switch to queueing instead of immediate merge:

```yaml title=.mergify.yml
queue_rules:
  - name: default
    autoqueue: true
    queue_conditions:
      - base = main
      - check-success = ci
```

- The queue keeps PRs updated and merges them only after passing on the latest
  base

- You can set [priorities](/merge-queue/priority),
  [batches](/merge-queue/batches), and [parallel
  checks](/merge-queue/parallel-checks) later

## Feature parity quick table

- Merge methods: squash/merge/rebase → supported

- Delete branch after merge → [`delete_head_branch`
  action](/workflow/actions/delete_head_branch)

- Rebase/update before merge →
  [`rebase`](/workflow/actions/rebase)/[`update`](/workflow/actions/update)
  actions or merge queue `update_method`

- Require labels → conditions `label = `

- Restrict by authors/paths → conditions `author =`, `files ~=`, etc.
