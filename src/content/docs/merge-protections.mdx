> Mergify Merge Protections extend GitHub's native Branch Protections & Rulesets with fine‑grained, dynamic rules.

## Overview

Merge Protections let you:

- Enforce advanced success criteria on pull requests (title patterns, labels,
  CI signals, file changes, authorship, etc.)

- Express dependencies between pull requests (block merge until others are
  merged)

- Schedule when merges may occur (or enforce freezes)

- Provide consistent, explainable feedback via a single required check

## Why Use Merge Protections Instead of Only GitHub Rulesets?

| Capability | GitHub Native | Mergify Merge Protections |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| Conditional logic (complex AND/OR on PR metadata) | No | Extensive |
| Depends‑On relationships | ❌ | ✅ |
| Time / schedule based merge windows | ❌ | ✅ |
| Repository freeze (manual or scheduled) | ❌ | ✅ |
| Single composite check gate | Partial | ✅ |

## How They Work

1. You enable Merge Protections in the dashboard.
2. A single check `Mergify Merge Protections` appears on every PR.
3. Your protection rules determine whether that check passes.
4. You mark the check as Required in GitHub Branch Protection / Rulesets.
5. PRs cannot merge unless all active protection rules succeed.
