CI Insights helps you monitor your pipelines, detect flaky tests and jobs, and optimize
your CI efficiency. This guide walks you through enabling CI Insights via
GitHub and covers basic configuration steps.

## Understanding CI Insights

### Components

CI Insights provides monitoring and analysis for two key components of your CI pipeline:

#### Jobs

Jobs are the individual tasks that run as part of your CI pipeline (e.g.,
build, test, deploy steps). CI Insights tracks job-level metrics and health
status.

#### Tests

Tests are the individual test cases that run within your test suites. CI
Insights captures detailed test-level data to help identify problematic test
cases.

### Flaky Detection

CI Insights automatically detects flaky behavior in both jobs and tests using the same criteria:

A **flaky job** or **flaky test** is one that has 2 different conclusions on
the same SHA1. For example, if a job or test runs twice on the same commit and
once fails while the other succeeds, it's considered flaky because the outcome
is not consistent with the same code.

To set up systematic flaky test detection in your CI pipeline, see our
dedicated [Flaky Test Detection guide](/ci-insights/flaky-test-detection).

## Enabling CI Insights for GitHub

1. Enable CI Insights on your repositories by visiting the [GitHub Integration
   page](https://dashboard.mergify.com/integrations/github)
   ([docs](/integrations/github)).

2. In order to upload your test results, you'll need to [configure your
   test](#test-framework-configuration). Before doing so, make sure you set
   your `MERGIFY_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions secrets.

   To find your token in the Mergify dashboard, go to `Settings` > `CI
   Insights`:

   <Image src={TokenScreenshot} alt="CI Insights Token" />

   Once copied, paste it into your GitHub Actions secrets:

   <Image src={GHSecretsScreenshot} alt="GitHub Actions Secrets" />

   This token will be used to upload test reports.

3. Click on `CI Insights` in the Mergify dashboard navigation.
   You should start seeing your GitHub Actions job runs appear:

## Test Framework Configuration

CI Insights supports many test frameworks and captures test-level data from them.
Each framework requires a quick setup to ensure test results are parsed and uploaded properly.

Refer to the dedicated page for your specific framework to configure and verify your test output.
