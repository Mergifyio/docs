CI Insights helps you monitor your pipelines, detect flaky tests, and optimize
your CI efficiency. This guide walks you through enabling CI Insights via
GitHub and covers basic configuration steps.

## Enabling CI Insights for GitHub

1. Enable CI Insights on your repositories by visiting the [GitHub Integration
   page](https://dashboard.mergify.com/integrations/github)
   ([docs](/integrations/github)).

2. In order to upload your test results, you'll need to [configure your
   test](#test-framework-configuration). Before doing so, make sure you set
   your `MERGIFY_TOKEN` in GitHub Actions secrets.

   To find your token in the Mergify dashboard, go to `Settings` > `CI
   Insights`:

   <Image src={TokenScreenshot} alt="CI Insights Token" />

   Once copied, paste it into your GitHub Actions secrets:

   <Image src={GHSecretsScreenshot} alt="GitHub Actions Secrets" />

   This token will be used to upload test reports.

3. Click on `CI Insights` in the Mergify dashboard navigation.
   You should start seeing your GitHub Actions job runs appear:

   <Image src={MainScreenshot} alt="CI Insights" />

## Test Framework Configuration

CI Insights supports many test frameworks and captures test-level data from them.
Each framework requires a quick setup to ensure test results are parsed and uploaded properly.

Refer to the dedicated page for your specific framework to configure and verify your test output.
