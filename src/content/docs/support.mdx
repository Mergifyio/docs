At Mergify, we treat support as a core part of the product experience. Our goal
is to keep your merge automation running smoothly by making it simple to contact
the right team, set expectations, and understand the additional services
available to larger organizations.

## Contact Support Immediately

If you are stuck, use one of the following channels:

1. **Email:** <a href="mailto:support@mergify.com">support@mergify.com</a>.
  Include the affected repository, pull request number, and a short description
  (screenshots/log excerpts encouraged) so we can reproduce quickly.

2. **In-app ticket:** From the Mergify dashboard, go to **Help → Contact
  support** to submit a request. We automatically attach account context, which
  speeds up triage.

3. **Status follow-up:** Track platform availability at <a
  href="https://status.mergify.com">status.mergify.com</a> and reference
  incident IDs in your ticket for targeted updates.

These options are available to every Mergify user.

## Support Overview

We provide assistance to authorized users directly through the service as well as by email. While
resolution times can vary depending on complexity, our team commits to best-effort responses within
one (1) business day for every incoming request. You will always receive a human acknowledgement
confirming the scope and next steps.

Enterprise plans unlock additional collaboration channels beyond the default email queue:

- **Dedicated Slack channel:** Eligible enterprise customers receive a shared
  Slack channel with the Mergify team for higher-touch incident response,
  proactive reviews, and faster iteration.

- **Named support contacts:** We partner with your engineering leads to keep
  context warm and reduce time to resolution on recurring workflows.

Reach out to your account manager if you would like to enable or adjust these enterprise options.

## Premium Support

Organizations that need round-the-clock coverage can subscribe to our optional 24/7 Premium Support
package. This add-on provides prioritized routing, after-hours incident handling, and direct access
to on-call engineers. Contact <a href="mailto:sales@mergify.com">sales@mergify.com</a> to scope the
package and ensure it matches your operational requirements.

## What to Expect

When you open a support request, we:

1. Acknowledge the ticket and confirm the scope within one business day.
2. Investigate using the artifacts you provided and any telemetry available on our side.
3. Publish corrective updates when needed and confirm the outcome with you.

If a request requires product changes or in-depth consulting, we will clearly
outline the effort and any additional agreement needed before proceeding.
