In Mergify, you can leverage certain features like YAML anchors and aliases,
the `shared` key, and the `extends` key to reduce redundancy, maintain
consistency, and increase code reusability.

## YAML Anchors and Aliases

[YAML anchors (`&`) and aliases
(`*`)](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#anchors-and-aliases) are supported in the
[configuration file](/configuration/file-format). These allow you to reuse
configuration sections. For example, you can create a list of continuous
integration checks and use it in multiple sections:

```yaml
queue_rules:
  - name: hotfix
    queue_conditions:
      - and: &CheckRuns
        - check-success=linters
        - check-success=unit
        - check-success=functionnal
        - check-success=e2e
        - check-success=docker
  - name: default
    queue_conditions:
      - and: *CheckRuns
      - schedule=Mon-Fri 09:00-17:30[Europe/Paris]
```

## Sharing Configuration Sections

You can store anything in the `shared` key. Its main purpose is to provide a
place to put redundant YAML anchors:

```yaml
shared:
  my_ci: &common_checks
    - check-success=ci-one
    - check-success=ci-two

queue_rules:
  - name: hotfix
    queue_conditions:
      - and: *my_ci
  - name: default
    queue_conditions:
      - and: *my_ci
      - schedule=Mon-Fri 09:00-17:30[Europe/Paris]
```

## Extending Configuration Files

Mergify lets you extend your configuration file by including the configuration
from another repository. This feature is useful when you want to share and
reuse configuration rules across multiple repositories, helping maintain
consistency and reduce duplication.

To extend a configuration file, use the `extends` keyword at the top level of
your configuration file file and specify the repository name from which you
want to include the configuration.

```yaml
extends: organization/shared-config
```

:::caution
  The Mergify application must also be installed on the source repository
  that you want to import the configuration from.
:::

The configuration from the specified repository will be loaded and applied
before the one in the current repository. Here's an example:

```yaml
extends: organization/shared-config

pull_request_rules:
  - name: additional rule specific to this repository
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      label:
        add: ["repository-specific"]
```

:::caution
  - Values in the `shared` key will not be merged and shared between local and
    remote configurations.

  - Values in the `default` key will be merged and remote default values will
    apply to local configuration.
:::

## Extending YAML anchors

Mergify, by using the `extends` feature, also lets you extend the YAML anchors.
With the same duplication reduction goal, you can centralize all your anchors
inside one unique configuration file, that will be extended to others.

To extend the anchors, you simply have to define them in the configuration file
that will be extended to the current configuration file.
Then you can simply use the corresponding aliases inside the current
configuration file and Mergify will automatically replace them with
the anchors defined in the extended file.

The mechanism works as follows:

- Main configuration file using `extends` keyword with an undefined YAML alias:
```yaml
extends: organization/shared-config

pull_request_rules:
  - name: additional rule specific to this repository
    conditions: *my-extended-yaml-anchor
    actions:
      label:
        add: ["repository-specific"]
```

- Extended file containing the YAML anchor definition:
```yaml
shared:
  condition: &my-extended-yaml-anchor
    - label=my-label
```

- Final main configuration file:
```yaml
extends: organization/shared-config

pull_request_rules:
  - name: additional rule specific to this repository
    conditions:
      - label=my-label
    actions:
      label:
        add: ["repository-specific"]
```

:::caution
  If you define the same anchor in both files, with different values,
    Mergify will keep the value local to each file.
