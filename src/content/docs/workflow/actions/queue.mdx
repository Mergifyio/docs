title: Queue
description: Put your pull request into the merge queue.
---

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable';

The `queue` action allows you to put a pull request into the [merge
queue](/merge-queue). By placing pull requests in the queue, you can make sure
they are up-to-date and control their processing based on their priority.

If your queue rule has [`autoqueue:
true`](/merge-queue/rules#autoqueueing-pull-requests), matching pull requests
are added automatically and you usually do not need this action. Use the action
when you want explicit, ruleâ€‘driven or conditional enqueueing beyond what
`queue_conditions` express.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable def="QueueActionModel" />

## Examples

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: put PRs in queue
    conditions:
      - label = queue-me
    actions:
      queue:
```

In this example, any pull request that has the label `queue-me` will be
automatically queued. The pull request still needs to match the
`queue_conditions` defined in the queue to enter the queue.
