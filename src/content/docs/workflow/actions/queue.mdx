title: Queue
description: Put your pull request into the merge queue.

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../../components/Tables/ActionOptionsTable';

The `queue` action allows you to put a pull request into a [merge
queue](/merge-queue). By placing pull requests in a queue, you can make sure
they are up-to-date and control their processing based on their priority.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable def="QueueActionModel" />

## Examples

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: put PRs in queue
    conditions:
      - label = queue-me
    actions:
      queue:
```

In this example, any pull request that has the label `queue-me` will be
automatically queued. The pull request still needs to match the
`queue_conditions` defined in the queue to enter the queue.
