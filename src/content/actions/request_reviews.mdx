## Examples

### Basic Assignment

Here's an example of how to use the `request_reviews` action:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: request review from user and team when pull request is labeled with `review`
    conditions:
      - label=review
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - user1
          - user2
        teams:
          - team1
```

### Flexible Reviewers Assignment

You can assign people for review based on any criteria you like. A classic is
to use the name of modified files to do it:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask jd to review changes on python files
    conditions:
      - files~=\.py$
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - jd
```

You can also ask entire teams to review a pull request based on, e.g., labels:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask the security team to review security labeled PR
    conditions:
      - label=security
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        teams:
          - "@myorg/security-dev"
          - "@myorg/security-ops"
```

### Random Review Assignment

It's not fair to ask for the same users or teams to always do the review. You
can rather randomly assign a pull request to a group of users.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask the security team to review security labeled PR
    conditions:
      - label=security
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          - jd
          - sileht
          - CamClrt
          - GuillaumeOj
       random_count: 2
```

In that case, 2 users from this list of 4 users will get a review requested for
this pull request.

If you prefer some users to have a larger portion of the pull requests
assigned, you can add a weight to the user list:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: ask the security team to review security labeled PR
    conditions:
      - label=security
    actions:
      request_reviews:
        users:
          jd: 2
          sileht: 3
          CamClrt: 1
          GuillaumeOj: 1
      random_count: 2
```

In that case, it's 3 times more likely then the user `sileht` will get a pull
request assigned rather than `GuillaumeOj`.
