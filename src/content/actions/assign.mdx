title: Assign
description: Assign a pull request to a user.

import { Alert } from '../../components/Alert';

The `assign` action allows you to assign one or more users to a pull request
when the conditions you specify are met. This can help automate the process of
designating the right people to handle specific pull requests, based on your
conditions. This can significantly streamline your pull request management
process and ensure that the right people are always aware of and working on the
pull requests that require their attention.

## Parameters

{/* FIXME: auto generate https://linear.app/mergify/issue/MRGFY-2196/automatically-generate-actions-configuration-parameters-from-schema */}

As the list of users in `add_users` or `remove_users` is based on
[templates](data-type#template), you can use, e.g., `{{author}}` to assign the
pull request to its author.

{/* FIXME: maybe lower than "alert" */}

<Alert>
  Make sure the users you specify in the assign action have the necessary
  access to the repository and the pull request. If the specified user does not
  have the necessary permissions, the action will fail.
</Alert>
