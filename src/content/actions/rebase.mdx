The `rebase` action makes Mergify rebase the pull request on top of its base
branch. This is useful when you want to ensure that your pull request is always
up-to-date with the latest changes from the base branch.

<Info>
{/* FIXME: link to merge queue doc */}
You do not need to use this action if you use the merge queue. The merge
queue automatically update the pull requests it processes as necessary, making
sure they are tested with up-to-date code before being merged.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action='rebase'/>

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `rebase` action:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: continuously rebase pull request when it's labeled with `rebase`
    conditions:
      - label=rebase
    actions:
      rebase:
```

Note that this will rebase the pull request as long as it has the label.

If you wanted to do rebase only once, you would also need to remove the label.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: rebase pull request once when it's labeled with `rebase`
    conditions:
      - label=rebase
    actions:
      rebase: {}
      label:
        remove:
          - rebase
```
