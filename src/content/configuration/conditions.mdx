## Introduction

Conditions are an essential component of Mergify rules, as they define the
criteria that must be met for a rule to be applied. By utilizing conditions,
you can create highly customizable and flexible rules tailored to your specific
workflow requirements. Conditions enable you to target pull requests based on
various factors such as their status, properties, labels, and associated
statuses or checks.

In this guide, we will explore the structure, syntax, and usage of conditions
in Mergify rules. You will learn how to craft effective conditions that help
you automate and streamline your pull request management process.

## Structure of a Condition

A condition in Mergify rules is composed of three key components: attributes,
operators, and values, along with optional modifiers. These components work
together to define the criteria that must be met for the condition to be
considered true.

The grammar for a condition is as follows:

`[ "-" ] [ "#" ] <attribute> [ <operator> <value> ]`

### Modifiers

- The optional minus (`-`) operator at the beginning of the condition negates
  the result of the condition, acting as a "not" operator.
- The optional hash (`#`) operator is used to evaluate the length of a list when
  the attribute is a list.

### Attributes

Attributes represent the properties or characteristics of a pull request that
you want to evaluate in your condition. These can include elements such as the
number of approvals, the presence of specific labels, or the status of CI
checks.

### Operators

Operators are used to compare the attribute to a specified value. Mergify
supports various comparison operators (e.g., `=`, `!=`, `<`, `>`).

When the attribute is a list, comparison operators behave as if "any" is used on
the list, meaning the condition will return true if any element of the list
matches the given operator and value.

### Values

Values are the reference points used to evaluate the attribute. They can be
strings, numbers, or booleans, depending on the attribute being evaluated.

For example, consider the following condition:

`#approved-reviews-by>=2`

In this condition:

- The attribute is `approved-reviews-by`, which represents the list of
  approved reviewers for a pull request.
- The operator is `>=`, which means "greater than or equal to."
- The value is `2`, which indicates the minimum number of approved reviews
  required for the condition to be true.
- The hash (`#`) operator is used to evaluate the length of the list of
  approved reviewers.

Understanding the structure of a condition is crucial for creating effective
Mergify rules that cater to your specific needs and requirements.


## Attributes

Attributes are properties of pull requests or events used to filter and evaluate
the conditions within rules. They can be used to create more specific and
targeted rules for your repository.
