title: Mergify Configuration File
description: Everything you need to know about Mergify configuration file
---

The Mergify configuration file is an essential component of using our platform
effectively. This document will provide a comprehensive overview of the file,
including its name, format, and the data structure schema.

## Configuration File Name

Mergify applies the following rule to find and use its configuration:

- It reads the file named `.mergify.yml`, or, as a fallback,
  `.mergify/config.yml` or `.github/mergify.yml` from the repository root
  directory.

- It reads the file from the default repository branch configured on GitHub —
  usually `main`.

{/* FIXME: add link ot extending the configuration file */}

- It can extends the configuration by another configuration using the keyword
  `extends` — see "extending the configuration file".


## File Format

The configuration file uses the [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format, which is both
human-readable and machine-parsable. YAML is easy to read and edit, making it a
popular choice for configuration files.

The file main type is a dictionary and each key of the dictionary configures a
different aspect of Mergify:

{/* FIXME: add link to sections */}

- `pull_request_rules` configures Automation Workflow;
- `queue_rules` configures the Merge Queue;
- `partition_rules` configures monorepository support in the merge queue;
- `commands_restrictions` configures whos is able to run commands;
- `defaults` allows to configure default options for various actions;
- `shared` allows to define any YAML payload that can be used using YAML
  anchors;
- `extends` allows to extend the configuration file by importing another
  configuration file.
