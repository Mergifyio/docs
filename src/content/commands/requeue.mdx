title: Mergify Requeue Command
description: Allow a pull request to re-enter a merge queue.
---

The `requeue` command allows you to manually re-add a pull request to Mergify's
merge queue. This is especially useful if, for some reason, a pull request has
been removed from the queue or if you've made configuration changes and you
want the pull request to be reconsidered based on the new merge queue settings.

## Syntax

To use the `requeue` command, comment on the pull request with:

```text
@mergifyio requeue
```

Upon receiving the command, Mergify will place the pull request back in the
appropriate merge queue, considering its conditions.

## Example

Suppose you have a pull request that was removed from the merge queue due to a
transient failure, or after making a crucial update to the pull request, you
want to ensure it's re-added to the queue. By commenting `@mergifyio requeue`
on the pull request, Mergify will reconsider it for merging, ensuring it's
queued appropriately.
