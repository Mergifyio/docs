title: Mergify Rebase Command
description: Rebase a pull request.
---

The `rebase` command provides users with an instant method to instruct Mergify
to rebase a pull request against its base branch. It's a handy way to ensure
that the pull request is updated with the latest changes from the base branch
without manually triggering a rebase.

By leveraging the `rebase` command, developers can keep their pull requests
up-to-date and maintain a clean commit history, enhancing the clarity and
quality of the project's development.

The `rebase` command provided by Mergify has several advantages over the native
GitHub rebase feature:

- Rebases are done using the
  [`--autosquash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#Documentation/git-rebase.txt---autosquash)
  option. This mean commits starting with `fixup!`, `squash!` or other commands
  will be honored.

- When the [`dismiss_reviews`](/workflow/actions/dismiss_reviews) action is
  being used, it will not reset the reviews if the rebase is executed by
  Mergify.

## Syntax

To make use of the `rebase` command, simply comment on the desired pull
request:

```text
@mergifyio rebase
```
