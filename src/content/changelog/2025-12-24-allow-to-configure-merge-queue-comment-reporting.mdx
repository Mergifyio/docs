Adding `status_comments` property to [merge queue configuration](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/file-format/#merge-queue) to reduce the level of reporting for queue status on github pull request:

-  `all`: Post comments for all queue events (entering queue, CI progress, outcomes).
-  `outcomes`: Only post comments for final outcomes (merged or dequeued with failure reason).
Example:

```yaml
merge_queue:
  status_comments: outcomes
```
