The `commits` attribute now supports addressing all the commits of a pull request in a [conditions by using the `*` operator](https://docs.mergify.com/conditions/#attributes).

You can write a condition such as `conditions[*].committer!=Bob` to verify that at least one committer of a pull request is not `Bob`.
