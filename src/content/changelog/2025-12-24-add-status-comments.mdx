Adding `status_comments` property to merge queue config to reduce the level of reporting for queue status on github pull request:

-  `all`: Post comments for all queue events (entering queue, CI progress, outcomes).
-  `outcomes`: Only post comments for final outcomes (merged or dequeued with failure reason).
