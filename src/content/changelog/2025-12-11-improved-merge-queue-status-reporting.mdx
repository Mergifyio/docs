Mergify now provides **richer, more informative status updates** directly on your pull requests when they enter the Merge Queue.

Instead of a single, static message, PRs now get **step-by-step feedback** about what’s happening: preparing the batch, waiting for CI, retrying, scheduled waits, and more. This gives developers clearer visibility into progress and removes the guesswork around “where is my PR?”.

This will include an estimated time of merge (still rolling out).
