The `status_comments` option in the `merge_queue` configuration now supports a `none` value, which disables all merge queue status comments on pull requests.

This provides users with three levels of control over queue notifications:

- `all` (default): Post comments for all queue events, including entering the queue, CI progress updates, and final outcomes
- `outcomes`: Only post comments for final outcomes (merged or dequeued with failure reason)
- `none`: Do not post any comments for queue status
Example configuration:

```yaml
merge_queue:
  status_comments: none
```

This is useful for repositories that want to reduce notification noise and rely solely on the merge queue dashboard or other monitoring tools for queue status updates.
