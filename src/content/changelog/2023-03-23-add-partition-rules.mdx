Mergify merge queue now offers a new section named [`partition_rules`](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#partition-rules). This new sections helps splitting merge queues in different independent partitions that can be processed in parallel. This is especially useful when using merge queues on top of monorepos.
