Mergify now supports GitHub review decision attributes, named `branch-protection-review-decision`. This field can be either `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED` or `REVIEW_REQUIRED`. It indicates whether code owners have approved or not the pull request.

It is automatically injected by Mergify when its usage is detected in the GitHub branch protection settings.
