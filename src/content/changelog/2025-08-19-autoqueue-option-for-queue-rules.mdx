We’ve added a new `autoqueue` field to `queue_rules`.

When `autoqueue: true`, pull requests that match the rule’s conditions are **automatically added to the merge queue** during workflow processing. This removes the need to add explicit queue actions in your rules, reduces configuration complexity, and ensures PRs don’t get missed.

By default, autoqueue is set to false to preserve current behavior.

📖 Learn more in the docs: [Auto-queueing pull requests](https://docs.mergify.com/merge-queue/rules/#autoqueueing-pull-requests).
