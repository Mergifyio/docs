Weâ€™ve added a new `autoqueue` field to `queue_rules`.

When `autoqueue: true`, pull requests that match the ruleâ€™s conditions are **automatically added to the merge queue** during workflow processing. This removes the need to add explicit queue actions in your rules, reduces configuration complexity, and ensures PRs donâ€™t get missed.

By default, autoqueue is set to false to preserve current behavior.
