The merge queue is now pauseable. This means it is nos possible to stop processing the merge queue altogether and stop scheduling new checks.

This is exposed [through the API](https://docs.mergify.com/api/#/operations/create_queue_pause_repos__owner___repository__queue_pause_put) at `/repos/{owner}/{repository}/queue/pause`.
