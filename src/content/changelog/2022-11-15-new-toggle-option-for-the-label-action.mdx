The current way of toggling a label using Mergify is usually to write 2 sets of conditions, such as:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: add ci-fail label when a CI fails
    conditions:
      - "#check-failure>0"
    label:
      add:
        - ci-fail

  - name: remove ci-fail label when no CI fail
    conditions:
      - -"#check-failure>0"
    label:
      remove:
        - ci-fail
```

As this can be quite cumbersome to write and maintain, it is now possible to toggle a label based on the conditions written a rule. The above example can be simplified with:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: toggle ci-fail label on CI failure
    conditions:
      - "check-failure>0"
    label:
      toggle:
        - ci-fail
```

This will add or remove the label `ci-fail` depending whether the rule matches or not.
