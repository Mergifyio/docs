It is now possible to limit usage of commands using the [commands restrictions](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/#commands-restrictions).

For example, to limit backport commands for pull requests coming from the main branch:

```yaml
commands_restrictions:
  backport:
    conditions:
      - base=main
```

Another example, to limit backport commands usage to a specific team (or user):

```yaml
commands_restrictions:
  backport:
    conditions:
      - sender=@team
```
