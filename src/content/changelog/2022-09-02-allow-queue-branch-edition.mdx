[A new setting named ](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules)[`allow_queue_branch_edit`](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules) has been added to the merge queue. It allows to configure whether modification done to the branch being built and tested by Mergify should cancel the job or be allowed. The default is `false`.
