The merge queue now supports [a new setting named ](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules)[`queue_branch_merge_method`](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules). It allows to configure the merge behaviour of the merge queue:

- By default, when unset, Mergify merges the original pull requests that are being tested in the queue.
- When set to `fast-forward`, Mergify will rather merge the branch that is being tested by fast-forwarding the base branch to the tested branch.
