You can now leverage [templates](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/#template) in the [label action](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/label/).

This allows for example to add labels based on the branch name:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: tag with branch
	  conditions:
      - base!=main
    actions:
      label:
        add:
          - branch:{{base}}
```
