You can now toggle column visibility in CI Insights tables

- Your preferences are saved locally, so hidden columns stay hidden when you come back.
- Hidden columns are also stored in the URL, so you can share the exact same view with teammates.
- New columns will always show up by default, even if you’ve hidden others.
