---

The `requeue` command has been deprecated. Use `@mergifyio queue` instead to re-queue pull requests that were removed from the merge queue.

### What changed

- **`@mergifyio queue`**** now re-queues pull requests.** After a pull request is dequeued for any reason (check failures, conflicts, timeouts, etc.), posting `@mergifyio queue` will re-queue it.
- **`@mergifyio requeue`**** still works** but is now an alias for `queue`. No action is required immediately, but we recommend updating your workflows.
### Migration

Replace any usage of `@mergifyio requeue` with `@mergifyio queue`. If you have automation rules using the `requeue` action, update them to use `queue`.
