The [queue](https://docs.mergify.com/workflow/actions/queue/) action from workflow automation has deprecated all of its configuration options. You should configure queue options directly in the `queue_rules` configuration for each queue. A brownout day is planned the September 16, 2024  and the options will be removed the October 21, 2024.
