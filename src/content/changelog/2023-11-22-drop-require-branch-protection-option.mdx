This is now replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode`. See [queue rules documentation.](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/file-format/#queue-rules)

For example: 

- `require_branch_protection: false` must be replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode: merge`
- `require_branch_protection: true` must be replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode: queue`
