This is now replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode`. See [queue rules documentation.](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/file-format/#queue-rules)



For example: 

- `require_branch_protection: false` must be replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode: merge `
- `require_branch_protection: true` must be replaced by `branch_protection_injection_mode: queue `
