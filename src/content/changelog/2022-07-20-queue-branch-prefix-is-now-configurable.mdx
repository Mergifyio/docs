The queue action now exposes [a new setting named ](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules)[`queue_branch_prefix`](https://docs.mergify.com/actions/queue/#queue-rules). This can be used to configure the prefix used by Mergify when creating transient branches for its merge queue. The default is `mergify/merge-queue/`.
