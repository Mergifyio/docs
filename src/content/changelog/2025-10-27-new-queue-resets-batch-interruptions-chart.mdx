We added a new dedicated chart to track errors and problems in the merge queue, including failed checks, timeouts, queue resets, and batch failures.

The existing "Merge Queue Checks Outcomes" chart has been renamed to "PR Exit Reasons" and now focuses exclusively on normal operational outcomes like successful merges, manual dequeues, and PR updates.

This separation makes it easier to quickly identify and prioritize CI/CD problems.
