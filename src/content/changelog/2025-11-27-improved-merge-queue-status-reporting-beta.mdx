Mergify now provides **richer, more informative status updates** directly on your pull requests when they enter the Merge Queue.

Instead of a single, static message, PRs now get **step-by-step feedback** about what’s happening: preparing the batch, waiting for CI, retrying, scheduled waits, and more. This gives developers clearer visibility into progress and removes the guesswork around “where is my PR?”

This new reporting system is **in beta**, and we’re actively refining it.

👉 **If you have feedback or ideas**, please share them. It helps us improve the experience for everyone.
