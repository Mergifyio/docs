The conditions can now use the details from the commits composing a pull requests.

For example, you could write a rule like this:

```yaml
pull_request_rules
  - name: label when PR is stale
    conditions:
      - "commits[-1].date_committer < 7 days ago"
    actions:
      label:
        toggle:
          - stale
```
