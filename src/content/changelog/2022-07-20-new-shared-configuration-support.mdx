The configuration file now supports [a new key named ](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/#shared)[`shared`](https://docs.mergify.com/configuration/#shared) which allows to share configuration across several YAML rules.

# Example

```yaml
shared:
  my_ci: &common_checks
    - check-success=ci-one
    - check-success=ci-two

queue_rules:
  - name: hotfix
    conditions: *common_checks

  - name: default
    conditions:
    - check-success=slow-ci
    - and: *common_checks

pull_request_rules:
  - name: Default merge
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - and: *common_checks
    actions:
      queue:
        name: default

  - name: Hotfix merge
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - label=hotfix
    actions:
      queue:
        name: hotfix
```
