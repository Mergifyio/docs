---

You can now use the `*=` operator in conditions to match values using glob patterns.

This makes it easier to target branches, labels, or files that follow naming conventions or structured patterns.

Examples:

```yaml
  - branch_name *= "release/*"
  - label *= "team-*"
  - files *= foobar/**/*.py
```
