Deploying and transitioning to Mergify's Merge Queue involves two potential
phases, each corresponding to different organizational preferences and maturity
with the tool:

1. **Hybrid Phase**: This phase allows for a mix, where manual merges and
   Mergify coexist, aiding teams in the transitional period. This approach does
   not disrupt existing workflows drastically and lets teams gradually adapt to
   the automated merge queue.

2. **Exclusive Mergify Merge Phase**: In this phase, organizations can choose
   to enforce that only Mergify merges the pull requests, leveraging GitHub
   Branch Protection settings. This ensures a more streamlined, organized, and
   automated approach to merging.

None of those phases are mandatory, and they are defined here mostly as
guidelines to inspire what your deployment scenario could be, and what your
final workflow could look like.

## Phase 1: Hybrid Phase â€” Coexisting Manual and Mergify Merges

### Understanding the Hybrid Approach

In the hybrid phase, while the automated queue is in place, developers can
still merge manually as usual. This flexibility is especially useful when
transitioning gradually, ensuring minimal disruption to existing workflows.

### Potential Drawbacks

- **Queue Disruption**: Manual merges might interrupt the flow of the automated
  merge queue, making the process less optimal.

- **Extra CI Time**: When manual merges bypass the queue, it might reset the
  jobs scheduled in Mergify, resulting in additional CI time and resource
  usage.

### Steps for Hybrid Phase

1. **Educate the Team**: Brief the team on the new Mergify queue system and its
   benefits, encouraging them to prioritize the queue over manual merges.

2. **Monitor Usage**: Regularly check how often the queue is being bypassed and
   encourage more use of Mergify for merging. You can monitor usage by checking
   who merged a pull request and notify someone when the queue is bypassed
   using an automation rule:
   ```yaml
   pull_request_rules:
     - name: notify on manual merge
       conditions:
         - merged-by!=mergify[bot]
       actions:
         comment:
           # replace <your-username> by your GitHub login
           message: Hey @<your-username>, this PR has been merged manually.
   ```

3. **Gather Feedback**: Understand any resistance or issues the team is facing
   with using the Mergify queue and address them promptly.

## Phase 2: Exclusive Mergify Merge Phase

### Enforcing Mergify for Merging

Once the team is comfortable with Mergify, you can choose to enforce Mergify
exclusively for merging pull requests through GitHub Branch Protection
settings.

### Steps to Enforce Exclusive Mergify Merges

1. **Go to Repository Settings**: Navigate to `Settings` in your repository and
   locate the `Branches` section.

2. **Create/Add a Branch Protection Rule**: Click on `Add rule` and configure
   the rule for the branch you wish to protect, typically `main` or `master`.

3. **Configure Status Checks**: Under the rule, enable `Restrict who can push
   to match branches` and add Mergify as the authorized user.

4. **Save Changes**: After configuring, click `Create` or `Save changes`.

## Conclusion

Transitioning to Mergify can be a smooth process, whether you choose to operate
in a hybrid mode initially or move directly to exclusive Mergify merges. By
configuring appropriately and addressing the team's needs and concerns during
the transition, you can ensure a more efficient, orderly, and automated
development workflow.

Remember, the transition to Mergify is not just about enforcing new tools but
about optimizing workflows and fostering a collaborative and efficient
development environment. Take the time to educate, adapt, and make the most out
of Mergify's capabilities!
