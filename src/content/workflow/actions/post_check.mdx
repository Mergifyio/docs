The `post_check` action allows Mergify to create a check-run on a pull request.
This can be useful in situations where you want to add a custom check to the
status of a pull request based on Mergify's evaluation.

<Info>
  Checks posted by Mergify using this action are usable as any other condition.
  See the [example below](post_check#enforcing-conventional-commits).
</Info>

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="post_check" />

As the `title` and `summary` are
[templates](/configuration/data-types#template), you can benefit from any [pull
request attributes](/configuration/conditions#attributes-list), e.g. `{{author}}`,
and also these additional variables:

- `{{ check_rule_name }}` the name of the rule that triggered this action;

- `{{ check_succeed }}` is `true` if all the conditions match, `false`
  otherwise;

{/* FIXME: add an example with a screenshot */}

- `{{ check_conditions }}` the list of all conditions with a checkbox marked if
  the condition matches.

## Examples

### Check Number of Approvals

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: post a check when PR is approved
    conditions:
      - "#approved-reviews-by>=2"
    actions:
      post_check:
        title: PR Approved
        summary: This PR has been approved by at least 2 developers.
```

In this example, when a pull request has at least 2 approved reviews, Mergify
will add a new check titled "PR Approved" and set the summary and text as
indicated. This will be visible in the checks section of the pull request on
GitHub.

### Enforcing Conventional Commits

You might want to enforce some guidelines as how to write pull request titles.
The following rules add such a check, making sure your team follows
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

The check will be posted only on pull requests targeting the main branch. The
check's conclusion will be a success if the title contains a conventional
commit type, otherwise it will be a failure.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Conventional Commit
    conditions:
      - base=main
    actions:
      post_check:
        success_conditions:
          - "title~=^(fix|feat|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert)(?:\\(.+\\))?:"
        title: |
          {% if check_succeed %}
          Title follows Conventional Commit
          {% else %}
          Title does not follow Conventional Commit
          {% endif %}
        summary: |
          {% if not check_succeed %}
          Your pull request title must follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
          {% endif %}
```

The result of this check will be visible in GitHub user interface, near the
merge button.

Checks posted by Mergify using this action are usable for any other conditions.
Taking the, you could use the posted check to add a label when a pull request
does not match your convention:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: label non compliant pull requests
    conditions:
      - "check-failure=Rule: Convention Commit (post_check)"
    label:
      toggle:
        - non-compliant
```
