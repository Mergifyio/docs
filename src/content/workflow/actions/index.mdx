Actions are the engine that powers Mergify. They define what Mergify should do
when a set of conditions is met. This can range from merging a pull request,
updating it with the latest changes, commenting on the pull request, assigning
it to a user, adding labels, and so much more.

In essence, actions are the tasks that Mergify performs on your behalf to
automate your pull request management workflow. By carefully crafting and
combining actions, you can create a highly efficient and automated process
that takes care of most of the routine tasks associated with pull request
management.
