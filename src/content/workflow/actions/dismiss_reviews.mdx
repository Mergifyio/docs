title: Dismiss Reviews
description: Dismiss previous reviews on a pull request.

import ActionOptionsTable from '../../../components/ActionOptionsTable';

The `dismiss_reviews` action allows Mergify to automatically dismiss approved
or changes requested reviews when new commits are pushed to the pull request.

The `dismiss_reviews` action is a powerful tool that can help maintain the
freshness and relevance of reviews in your pull request workflow.

## Parameters

<ActionOptionsTable action="dismiss_reviews" />

## Examples

### Re-Review

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: dismiss reviews when new commits are pushed, if the label "re-review" is present
    conditions:
      - base=master
      - label=re-review
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
```

In this example, Mergify will automatically dismiss any reviews when new
commits are pushed to a pull request targeting the `master` branch, but only if
the pull request has been labeled with "re-review".

### Team-based Dismiss

You could also only dismiss the outdated reviews if the author is not a member
of a particular team. This allows to keep the approval if the author is
trusted, even if they update their code:

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: remove outdated reviews for non trusted authors
    conditions:
      - base=main
      - author!=@mytrustedteam
    actions:
      dismiss_reviews:
```
