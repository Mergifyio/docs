The `github_actions` action enables Mergify to seamlessly dispatch existing
GitHub workflows within a repository when specified conditions are satisfied.
By integrating this action, users can optimize their CI/CD pipeline, invoking
specific GitHub Actions based on Mergify's conditions.

<Info>
  To use the `github_actions` action, ensure your workflow includes the
  `workflow_dispatch` trigger. Additionally, Mergify requires write permissions
  on Actions. Navigate to Mergify's UI to accept the permissions necessary for
  this action.

## Examples

### Dispatching GitHub Workflows with Inputs

To dispatch two workflows named `hello_world_workflow.yaml` and
`foo_workflow.yaml` when a pull request is labeled with "dispatch", use the
following rule. Here, the `hello_world_workflow.yaml` workflow accepts two
inputs, which are defined as `name` and `age`.

```yaml
pull_request_rules:
  - name: Dispatch GitHub Actions
    conditions:
      - label=dispatch
    actions:
      github_actions:
        workflow:
          dispatch:
            - workflow: hello_world_workflow.yaml
              inputs:
                name: steve
                age: 42
            - workflow: foo_workflow.yaml
```
